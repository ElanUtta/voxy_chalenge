# Welcome to Voxy Challenge!

Hi! I'm Elan Utta and for this challenge I choosed the framework next. 

The most challenge part was the regex to use inside the split the text in someway the program detected /n/t/r and for that here is the /s that englobes all of them. 


# Example Code

    const total_words  = () => {
	    return  words.split(/\s/).filter(e => (e !=  '')).length
    }


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.
